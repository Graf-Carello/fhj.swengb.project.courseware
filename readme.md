## Introduction

Our Courseware project contains multiple database tables.
We use Student, Homework, Exam, Course, Lecture, and Project as tables.
The table Course should be the main anchor for all our other table.
It is possible to export the databse entries from every table and the output can be stored as a file.
Each table has the main CRUD features.
