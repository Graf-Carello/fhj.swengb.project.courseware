### Courseware App

Our Courseware App takes use of the CRUD functionality.
The project contains multiple database tables.
We use Student, Homework, Exam, Course, Lecture, and Project as tables.
The whole navigation through the Courseware App takes place on an easy to use interface after the start of the application.
It is possible to export the databse entries from every table and the output can be stored as a file.
Each table has the main CRUD features.
